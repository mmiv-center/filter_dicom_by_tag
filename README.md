## TODO

- (done) Use dcmj2pnm to create a montage for all slice images per image series. Add json for study and series instance uids.
- (done) Use a dark theme to make the data speak, use frame color to indicate classification, use overlay color to indicate selection (positive and negative)
- (done) Use a cache per study, ask at the beginning if the cache should be re-generated or if the date of the cache is ok
- getAllData.sh does not work for large projects like Hofte89
- Add REDCap measures for each participant to all studies for this participant
